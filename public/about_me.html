<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Im a mother of 2 beautiful boys, my life basically revoles around them.
Sometimes i can be a boring person i like to be a home body at times. Im not an adventure type of person, Although i like to spend time with family and enjoy being together. 
I love certain hoildays even more now than i ever have simply because the joy it brings to my children.</p> 

<p>I like to spend afternoons outside with my kids and watch them play or either join along with them. So far im enjoying this class im taking it gives me more knowledge about computer skills although it does make me feel better about myself and makes me feel im being progressive about life and everyday hobbies.</p>
